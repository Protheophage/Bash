.TH AIC 1 "August 2024" "2.0" "Automated Image Collector"
.SH NAME
AIC \- Automated Imaging and Cloning
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B AIC
[\-\-dc3dd | \-3] [\-\-hash | \-h]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B AIC
Automates the process of imaging and cloning all drives attached to your computer, excluding the boot drive and the destination drive. For forensic image collections it supports optional hashing and the use of
.B dc3dd.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-dc3dd, \-3
Use
.B dc3dd
instead of
.B dd
for imaging.
.TP
.B \-\-hash, \-h
Generate SHA-256 hashes for the source and destination images.
.SH USAGE
.IP "1."
Find the destination drive by label:
The script looks for a drive labeled "DestDir". If not found, it prompts the user to enter the destination device path.
.IP "2."
Mount the destination drive:
The destination drive is mounted at
.B /mnt/destDrive.
.IP "3."
Create the images directory:
Ensures the directory
.B /mnt/destDrive/images
exists.
.IP "4."
Identify the boot drive:
The boot drive is identified and excluded from the imaging process.
.IP "5."
Find all other drives:
All drives except the boot drive and the destination drive are identified for imaging.
.IP "6."
Image the drives:
Each identified drive is imaged to the destination directory. If
.B \-\-dc3dd
is specified,
.B dc3dd
is used; otherwise,
.B dd
is used. If
.B \-\-hash
is specified, SHA-256 hashes are generated and logged.
.IP "7."
